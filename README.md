### Hi there 👋

- 🔭 I studied Computer Science and Mathematics as a double major, with a focus on Games Programming.
- 👯 My pipe dream is to work as a game producer and inspire teams and players through my passion and motivation.
- 💬 Ask me about my experience/history in game development. I'm currently working as a game dev. Sweet! 🍪
- 📫 You can email me on joshuavillgren@gmail.com if you want to get in touch.
- 📚 I love reading, hiking, singing, and music. Oh, and designing and playing video games, of course!
- 😄 Pronouns: he/him.
- ⚡ Fun facts: I've lived in four countries, visited over 20 and I have a travel and culture podcast with my amazing better-half, Veera. I'm prepared to move to almost anywhere for the right opportunity - I work to experience and learn.
